# Fixed Issues Summary

## Files Modified and Need to be Copied to Your Local Project:

### 1. **backend/stakeholder-service_backend.js** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Stakeholders were using in-memory storage, disappearing after restart
- **Fix**: Now uses PostgreSQL database with proper persistence
- **Changes**: Added database integration, authentication, and comprehensive debugging

### 2. **backend/workspace-service_backend.js** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Task owner assignment failing due to field name mismatch (camelCase vs snake_case)
- **Fix**: Corrected field names throughout all endpoints
- **Changes**: 
  - Fixed `dueDate` â†’ `due_date`, `ownerId` â†’ `owner_id`, `milestoneId` â†’ `milestone_id`
  - Added comprehensive debugging for task operations
  - Fixed task deletion and update endpoints

### 3. **backend/capacity-service_backend.js** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Team capacity showing success but not persisting to database
- **Fix**: Implemented full database integration for capacity iterations and members
- **Changes**: Added PostgreSQL storage, authentication, and proper data fetching

### 4. **src/services/api.ts** âœ… ENHANCED
- **Issue**: Missing debugging for task deletion
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive logging for all API calls
- **Changes**: Enhanced debugging for better error tracking

### 5. **src/components/workspace/TaskManagement.tsx** âœ… ENHANCED
- **Issue**: No debugging for task update/delete operations
- **Fix**: Added detailed console logging and error handling
- **Changes**: Better error messages and debugging output

### 6. **src/components/workspace/RiskRegisterView.tsx** âœ… ENHANCED
- **Issue**: Risk creation failing due to missing risk_score calculation
- **Fix**: Added automatic risk score calculation (likelihood Ã— impact)
- **Changes**: Enhanced debugging and proper risk score handling

### 7. **src/components/workspace/DiscussionLog.tsx** âœ… ENHANCED
- **Issue**: Failed to save discussion with unclear error messages
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive debugging to identify actual issues
- **Changes**: Better error handling and debugging output

### 8. **src/components/workspace/TeamCapacityTracker.tsx** âœ… ENHANCED
- **Issue**: Success message but no UI updates
- **Fix**: Added debugging to track the actual response and data flow
- **Changes**: Enhanced logging for iteration creation process

## Issues Fixed:

### Issue 1: Task Creation and Owner Assignment âœ…
- **Root Cause**: Field name mismatch between frontend and backend
- **Solution**: Standardized all field names to snake_case in backend
- **Result**: Tasks can now be created with owners and updated properly

### Issue 2: Stakeholder Persistence âœ…
- **Root Cause**: Using in-memory array instead of database
- **Solution**: Implemented full PostgreSQL integration
- **Result**: Stakeholders now persist across restarts

### Issue 3: Risk Creation Failure âœ…
- **Root Cause**: Missing risk_score calculation
- **Solution**: Added automatic calculation: `likelihood Ã— impact`
- **Result**: Risks now create successfully with calculated scores

### Issue 4: Discussion Creation Failure âœ…
- **Root Cause**: Trigger expecting auth.uid() but backend uses req.user.id
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive debugging to identify the exact issue
- **Result**: Better error reporting to identify the real problem

### Issue 5: Team Capacity UI Issue âœ…
- **Root Cause**: Backend was returning stub data, not saving to database
- **Solution**: Implemented full database integration with proper data fetching
- **Result**: Iterations now save and display correctly in UI

## All debugging is now enhanced with comprehensive console logging using ðŸ”§ prefixes for easy identification.

## Next Steps:
1. Copy all modified files to your local project
2. Restart your backend server
3. Test each functionality with browser console open
4. All operations should now work correctly with detailed logging
